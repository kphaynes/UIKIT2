            <p class="lead">A master-detail groups together two layout views in a one-to-many relationship. The information on the entire page displays one or more master objects and displays a detail object based on selection of a master. This is often expressed in a Split View consisting of two side-by-side panels: an item list and the selected itemâ€™s details but may also include a drilldown or a popup.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>When the user wants to quickly navigate and see details from item to item</li>
                <li>When there's a list of items with a lot of details to view or edit.</li>
                <li>When the user needs to interact with an object while it's master is "in context"</li>
                <li>When the user needs to explore a deeply nested tree, like a file system</li>
                <li>The screen is greater than 1024px, as master-details work best on large screens. Define the screens as two separate pages on smaller sizes.</li>
            </ul>
