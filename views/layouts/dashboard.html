            <ul>
                <li>Define the value of building this dashboard. You shouldnâ€™t build a dashboard just for the sake of having one. Establish the core question that this dashboard is trying to answer and what value the answer will provide. </li>
                <li>No matter which layout you choose, structure your information to draw the eye to the things that matter the most.</li>
                <li>To keep things simple, use a single font type, a limited color palette, and limited labels. Keep the dashboard clutter free and avoid putting too many charts in one place.</li>
                <li>Be mindful in labeling so understanding is immediate.</li>
                <li>To keep a dashboard easy to use, avoid too many advanced features such as filters and drill downs.</li>
            </ul>
